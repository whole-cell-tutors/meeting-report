\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past twenty years, computational modeling has become an essential and powerful tool for biological research, bioengineering, and medicine to analyze high-throughput molecular measurements and understand the molecular details of complex biological systems. Computational modeling has been used to identify new metabolic genes~\cite{Reed2006}, to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria~\cite{Lee2012}, and to identify potential new antimicrobial drug targets~\cite{Lee2009}.
Computational models also have the potential to enable bioengineers to design new microorganisms for industrial applications such as chemical synthesis, biofuel production, and waste decontamination, as well as to enable clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients. Realizing this potential requires more comprehensive and accurate computational models that are capable of predicting cellular behavior from genotype. Realizing this potential also requires improved simulation tools, as well as standardized tools for storing and exchanging models, simulation experiments, and visualizations~\cite{Macklin2014,Karr2015,Karr2015b,hucka2015promoting,Klipp07,path2models2013}.

Recently, researchers at Stanford University developed the first whole-cell model of the gram-positive bacterium \textit{Mycoplasma genitalium}~\cite{Karr2012}. The model represents the life cycle of a single Mycoplasma cell including the copy number dynamics of each metabolite, RNA, and protein species and accounts for every known gene function. The model is composed of 28 submodels, each of which is implemented using different mathematical formalisms including ordinary differential equations (\emph{ODE}s), flux balance analysis (\emph{FBA}), and Boolean rules (\emph{BR}s), and trained using different experimental data.

The model was implemented in MATLAB, is available open-source under the MIT license~\cite{wholeCell}~\cite{wholeCell}, and is extensively documented. This has enabled other researchers to use the model to conduct in silico experiments~\cite{Sanghvi2013, Purcell2013, Kazakiewicz2015}. 

Despite extensive documentation, the whole-cell model software is difficult to use. The software is large, complex, and time-consuming to learn. The software also cannot easily be reused to simulate other models because many of the \textit{M. genitalium} model details are intertwined with the software. In addition, many academic researchers, particularly those outside the United States, and many software developers cannot use the model software because MATLAB is proprietary and expensive. Compared to other languages with larger development communities such as Python, MATLAB has also few packages and development tools. In particular, MATLAB has limited support for object-oriented programming. Furthermore, the model software is not optimally efficient because MATLAB is just-in-time compiled and dynamically typed.

Covert and colleagues have developed several software programs including WholeCellKB~\cite{Karr2013}, WholeCellSimDB~\cite{Karr2014}, and WholeCellViz~\cite{Lee2013} to provide user-friendly interfaces to their simulation software. However, significant domain expertise is still required to use their software, particularly to construct new models. Therefore new modeling standards and simulation tools are needed to enable more researchers to develop and simulate their own whole-cell models. Such standards and software tools would enable researchers to develop whole-cell models more quickly, to explore models more deeply, and to evaluate models more rigorously. Furthermore, standards would make whole-cell models more reusable and comparable, as well as more searchable and retrievable through model repositories such as BioModels~\cite{juty2015biomodels,chelliah2015biomodels}.

Several software-agnostic systems biology standards have already been developed by the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (\emph{COMBINE})~\cite{le2011meeting}, including the Systems Biology Markup Language (\emph{SBML})~\cite{hucka2003}, the Cell Markup Language (\emph{CellML})~\cite{hedley_2001b}, the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (\emph{SED-ML})~\cite{sedml2011}, and the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (\emph{SBGN})~\cite{LeNovereHMMSS09}. SBML and CellML are languages for representing mathematical models. SBML is focused on describing biochemical pathway models, whereas CellML is focused on describing mathematical relationships. Both support several modeling formalisms including ODEs and FBA. Both SBML and CellML have been used to build hundreds of models of many biological systems. SED-ML is a language for describing computational experiments, including the simulation algorithm and parameter values. SED-ML enables scientists to reproduce simulations. SBGN encompasses three languages for  visually representing models. To date, none of these standards have been used to construct or simulate models as complex as the \textit{M. genitalium} model.

We organized the 2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School to train students in whole-cell modeling, as well as to evaluate the need for new standards and tools for whole-cell modeling. The majority of the school focused on encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} model using SBML. This was both a learning exercise, as well as a tool for evaluating SBML's ability to encode whole-cell models. The ultimate goal of the school was to encode an open-source whole-cell model in SBML, simulate the model using open-source software, and use the model to conduct in silico experiments encoded in SED-ML.

Here, we describe the summer school, outline our progress encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} model using SBML, and describe several standard extensions and software tools that are needed to support whole-cell modeling.

\section{The 2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School}
We organized the summer school to teach students how to build and encode models using COMBINE standards by encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} model using software-independent, standard representation formats.

\subsection{Organization}
The Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School was held March 9-13, 2015 at the University of Rostock, Germany. The school was organized by Dagmar Waltemath and Falk Schreiber and supported by the Volkswagen Foundation. 45 students, nine instructors, and two organizers participated in the school.

The school began with two introductory lectures on modeling and modeling standards. Jonathan Karr from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA presented an overview of whole-cell and multi-algorithm modeling. Michael Hucka from the California Institute of Technology, USA presented an overview of the SBML, SED-ML, and SBGN standards; open-source software tools that support these standards; and the COMBINE initiative. We also organized three discussions on model composition, particle-based state representation, and stochastic modeling. 

The majority of the school was devoted to hands-on active learning about whole-cell modeling and the COMBINE standards by encoding parts of the \textit{M. genitalium} model in SBML. The 28 sub-models were divided among ten groups of four to five students and one instructor.

Each day concluded with brief progress reports from each group. This facilitated discussion on common challenges and model integration and provided groups feedback.

We also organized a poster session and several social activities to provide the students opportunities to network.

\subsection{Educational outcome}
\comment{We surveyed the students to assess the educational outcome of the school.}{Karr}{What did the survey actually show?}
Most students reported gaining knowledge of whole-cell modeling, increased appreciation for reproducibility, and increased understanding of the SBML, SED-ML, and SBGN standards. Many students also reported learning about open-source software tools relevant to their own research.

In addition, many of the students reported that the school expanded their network. Several students commented that the school introduced them to workshops and job opportunities.

\subsection{Lessons learned for organizing research-based schools}
We learned several valuable lessons about how to best organize a research-based school. First, we learned that research-based schools should clearly outline the expected background knowledge and learning objectives and have well-organized learning activities. This helps students make informed decisions about whether to participate in the school, know how to prepare for the school, and learn efficiently.
Second, we concluded that students greatly enjoy learning through open research problems rather than through prescribed training exercises. This challenges students and engages them in research. This also helps students build practical skills which complement their undergraduate training.
Third, we concluded that open-ended project-based schools require a high teacher-to-student ratio, a flexible schedule, and multidisciplinary project teams. A high teacher to student ratio allows students to get feedback and iterate through potential solutions quickly. A flexible schedule enables impromptu lectures and discussions. Multidisciplinary teams enable students to work through difficult problems by drawing on perspectives from multiple fields. 

\section{Toward an SBML-encoded whole-cell model}
In addition to training young systems biology researchers, the second goal of the school was to encode the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model in SBML. To achieve this goal, most of the course was devoted to active learning sessions in which students were challenged to encode submodels of the \textit{M. genitalium} in SBML, integrate submodels into a single model, and simulate models using SED-ML. During these sessions, the students and instructors were divided into ten groups. Eight of the groups were tasked with encoding one or more submodels. The ninth group was tasked with developing a standards-compliant scheme to integrate the submodels into a single model. The tenth group was responsible for annotating and visualizing the model. Table~SI lists the ten groups and all of the students and instructors. 

\subsection{Submodel encoding}
The eight submodel encoding groups pursued various strategies to encode submodels in SBML. Several of the groups encoded submodels by first reading the submodel documentation, then drawing pathway diagrams using software tools such as CellDesigner~\cite{funahashi2008celldesigner} and VANTED~\cite{Rohn2012}, and finally writing scripts to generate SBML models from their diagrams using libSBML~\cite{bornstein_2008}. Other groups used modeling software tools such as Antimony~\cite{Smith2009}, BioUML~\cite{Kolpakov2006}, COBRApy~\cite{ebrahim2013cobrapy}, COPASI~\cite{Mendes2009}, iBioSim~\cite{Madsen2012}, and libRoadRunner~\cite{Somogyi17062015} to encode submodels based on their documentation. A few of the groups encoded submodels by converting the MATLAB code to SBML. These groups then generated SBGN diagrams from their SBML to better understand their submodels.

The groups encountered several challenges to encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} submodels in SBML. First, learning the submodels required a significant amount of time because the documentation only summarizes the submodels, the connection between the submodels and the associated pathway/genome database is unclear, and many of the submodels details are implemented directly in the MATLAB code. Fortunately, one of the principal authors of the \textit{M. genitalium} model participated in the school.

A second challenge to encoding the submodels was to encode serially executed MATLAB submodels in SBML which is parallel execution-oriented. Most of the groups decided to tackle this problem by formalizing MATLAB submodels as discrete stochastic models and simulating them using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm~\cite{gillespie1977}. This conversion imposed explicit internal submodel timescales that were not implemented in the original MATLAB submodels due to insufficient kinetic data.

A third challenge to encoding the submodels was to encode the random algorithms used by the MATLAB submodels in SBML. For example, the MATLAB translation submodel includes a random algorithm that assigns amino acids to individual polypeptides. This algorithm cannot easily be encoded in SBML because it is not equivalent to the Gillespie algorithm and plain SBML does not support random number generation. Most of the groups also solved this problem by formalizing submodels as stochastic models.

To encode many of the submodels in SBML, the groups also had to either enumerate the particle-based state representation used by the MATLAB submodels, or approximate the MATLAB submodels. The groups responsible for the transcription and translation submodels chose to approximate the MATLAB submodels by eliminating the internal dynamics of the polymerization of each RNA and polypeptide. Consequently, these submodels do not track the progress of individual RNA polymerases and ribosomes, account for base-specific transcription or translation rates, or predict RNA polymerase collisions. The groups responsible for the DNA submodels including replication, replication initiation, and transcriptional regulation, chose to enumerate the chromosome representation used by the MATLAB model by creating Boolean indicator variables to represent the existence and protein-binding status of each base. This enumerated representation requires millions of variables. Consequently, the corresponding SBML files are computationally expensive to parse and simulate. Enumerating the rules that govern the joint values of the enumerated variables, such as the rules that represent the steric effects of DNA-bound proteins by preventing proteins from binding neighboring bases, is also impractical. Furthermore, editing this enumerated representation is difficult because thousands of variables and rules must be edited rather than a small number of variable and rule patterns.

The lack of SBML simulator support for arrays was another challenge to encoding submodels in SBML. All of the groups overcame the lack of array support by enumerating individual array elements and all matrix algebra computations. This created verbose SBML files that are difficult to interpret, maintain, and edit. Enumerating the matrix algebra computations also increases the computational cost of simulation.

Together, these five challenges made it difficult for the groups to encode most of the MATLAB submodels in SBML. Going forward, the SBML simulators must be expanded to provide support for the new Multistate and Multicomponent Species and Array packages.

\subsection{Model integration}
The integration group was responsible for assembling the submodels into a single model. This included devising a scheme for representing global state variables, defining the interfaces exposed by the submodels to the global state variables, and developing a method to manage simultaneous writing of shared state variables by multiple submodels. The integration group defined the global state variables as the union of all state variables shared by at least two submodels rather than by explicitly defining a set of global state variables as done by the original MATLAB-based simulation. The advantages of this approach are that submodel developers are not also required to develop global state variables and that it minimizes the number of global state variables. The disadvantages of this approach are that the total set of variables is less transparent and that it requires users to learn all of the submodels and their naming conventions to analyze model simulations.

The integration group standardized the submodel interfaces by defining a variable naming convention. This convention makes it clear how multiple local submodel variables map onto the same global variable. The integration group used the same variable names as those used by the MATLAB implementation. Matrix and particle-based variables were enumerated by creating multiple variables differentiated by the suffixes.

The primary challenge faced by the integration group was how to handle concurrent editing of state variables shared by multiple submodels. The integration group explored several potential strategies to manage concurrent writing. First, they explored sequentially simulating the submodels and updating the global state variables. This avoids needing to merge variable changes. However, under this approach, submodels are simulated with different variable values within each time step. Consequently, simulation predictions are sensitive to the submodel execution order. 

The integration group also explored several more complex integration strategies that would enable submodels to be simulated with the same variable values within each time step. These strategies included reducing the submodel integration time step such that submodels do not request conflicting variable changes; dividing each of the shared state variables into multiple, independent sub-variables for each submodel, simulating the submodels in parallel, and merging the sub-variables to update global values; and using semaphores to manage concurrent variable changes whereby at each time step submodels request sets of atomic state changes and a controller decides which change sets are processed. Each of these strategies has different advantages and disadvantages. The first strategy is the simplest to understand and implement, but is computationally expensive. The second strategy is simple to implement and computationally efficient for independent variables, but is difficult to implement for sets of non-independent variables such as those that represent the protein occupancy of the chromosome. The third strategy is the most complex to implement, but is more general than the second strategy and more computationally efficient than the first. The integration group tested their integration strategies using iBioSim because iBioSim is one of the only SBML simulators to support the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Another challenge to integrating the submodels was lack of simulator for the multi-algorithm model composition. The integration group plans to overcome this limitation by adding support for multi-algorithm simulation to iBioSim.

Lastly, researchers will analyze in silico experiments to learn new biology.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Annotation, documentation, and visualization}
The documentation group was responsible for annotating the model.
The goal was to annotate every model entity with a cross reference to an external database such as ChEBI~\cite{Hastings2013} as in the case of small molecules and/or in terms of other model entities as in the case of chemical reactions.
The group wrote scripts to search molecular biology databases for every entity contained in the \textit{M. genitalium} model.
The main problem faced by the documentation group was that many model entities are not currently represented by any molecular biology database.
This shortcoming can easily be overcome by proposing new ontology terms to the databases.
This problem highlights the need to expand the molecular biology databases to aggregate data on more biological molecules and interactions. 

The documentation group also helped the other groups visualize submodels by providing advice on SBGN and diagramming tools such as VANTED~\cite{Rohn2012}.
The main visualization problem encountered by the documentation group was that whole-cell models require large diagrams that must be manually arranged to produce intuitive visualizations.

\subsection{Progress}
We produced preliminary SBML and SBGN versions of most of the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model submodels and finished SBML and SBGN versions for the cytokinesis submodel. Significant work remains to finish encoding the model in SBML. We must finish encoding the  submodels in SBML, expand iBioSim to support multi-algorithm modeling, thoroughly test the SBML model by reproducing all of the MATLAB model tests, and thoroughly diagram and document the SBML model.

\subsection{Future steps}
We hope to finish encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} submodels in SBML and integrating the SBML-encoded submodels into a single model that can be simulated by open-source software tools such as BioUML, COPASI, iBioSim, and libRoadRunner. Several students and instructors have continued to keep working and meeting online. Several students and instructors also plan to participate in a second meeting in October 2015 that will be held at the University of Utah, USA, immediately prior to the 2015 COMBINE Forum.

Going forward, we plan to publish SBML-encoded versions of each of the \textit{M. genitalium} submodels to BioModels, along with SED-ML tests, SBGN diagrams, and textual documentations. This would make the submodels searchable, retrievable, and reusable by other scientists. We believe this would be a valuable community resource. It would demonstrate how to build a whole-cell model and enable other researchers to build upon the \textit{M. genitalium} submodels.

\section{Toward SBML-, SED-ML-, and SBGN-based standards for whole-cell modeling}
The school was the first attempt to encode a whole-cell models using SBML. Consequently, the summer school generated several ideas about how to best expand the existing standards and tools to support whole-cell modeling.

\subsection{Standard extensions}
Taken together, expanded simulation software tools and databases are needed to facilitate whole-cell modeling. First, the SBML simulators must be expanded to support multi-algorithm simulations. This requires research to determine the best way to integrate heterogeneous submodels, including rigorously evaluating the schemes proposed by the integration group. Significant effort will also be needed to develop an efficient, parallelized simulator.

Second, the SBML simulators must implement the Multistate and Multicomponent Species (\emph{multi}) package to support hybrid population/particle-based state representation such as that used by BioNetGen \cite{Hlavacek2006, Hogg2014} and NFSim \cite{Sneddon2011}. This would also enable modelers to describe models more compactly, making models easier to understand, edit, and expand. For example, translation could be described using a single reaction pattern and arrays of mRNA-specific translation initiation rates and codon-specific elongation rates rather than by enumerating every individual reaction. By separating the mathematical descriptions and quantitative parameter values, reaction patterns would also make the connection between dynamical models and the experimental data used to inform their parameter values more transparent. Implementing the \emph{multi} package would also enable modelers to efficiently simulate models with large, combinatorial state spaces.

New user-friendly graphical editors must also be developed to enable researchers to easily build SBML files that take advantage of these new features. These graphical editors must also allow researchers to transparently map model parameters onto experimental data organized in pathway/genome databases.

In addition, our molecular biology databases such as ChEBI must be expanded to enable researchers to concretely define whole-cell models in terms of external entities. 

SBGN must also be expanded in several ways. SBGN must be expanded support hybrid diagrams which contain Process Descriptions, Entity Relationships, and Activity Flow nodes. The SBGN viewers must also be expanded to provide layout algorithms suitable for large visualizations and automatically display models at multiple levels of granularity using contextual zooming and model reduction. 

Together, these software, database, and SBGN expansions would enable more researchers to more easily build, manage, simulate, and reproduce whole-cell models and simulations. These new standards and software tools would also enable researchers to build more comprehensive and more accurate models. Ultimately, these new standards and software would enable whole-cell modeling to support bioengineering and personalized medicine.

\subsection{The whole-cell modeling pipeline}
We anticipate that such expanded standards and tools will enable a four step approach to whole-cell model-driven discovery (Fig.~\ref{fig:1}). First, researchers will assemble experimental data from numerous sources including databases such as SABIO-RK~\cite{Wittig2012} and UniProt~\cite{UniProt2015} into pathway/genome databases using software tools such as Pathway Tools~\cite{Karp2010} and WholeCellKB. Second, researchers will use pathway/genome databases and graphical modeling tools such as BioUML, COPASI, and iBioSim to build submodels and encode them using transparent languages such as SBML. Third, multi-algorithm simulators will be used to conduct in silico experiments. Lastly, software tools such as WholeCellSimDB and WholeCellViz will be used to discover new biology through exploring, visualizing, and analyzing in silico experiments.

\section{Conclusion}
The 2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School provided 45 young scientists hands-on training in whole-cell and multi-algorithm modeling by encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model in SBML. Additional courses are needed to provide students with deeper theoretical training in dynamical modeling, multi-algorithm modeling, model reduction, and parameter estimation, as well as practical training in model construction including data curation, model building, numerical optimization, model testing, and model analysis.

The summer school also made significant strides toward encoding the \textit{M. genitalium} whole-cell model using SBML for simulation by open-source software. We developed preliminary SBML versions of all of the submodels of the \textit{M. genitalium} model. Since the summer school, we have continued to encode the \textit{M. genitalium} model, and several of the students and instructors are participating in a second meeting prior to 2015 COMBINE Forum at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, USA. Ultimately, we hope to publish an SBML-encoded version of the model to BioModels. 

In addition, the summer school generated clear goals for expanding the existing SBML software tools to support whole-cell modeling. The SBML simulators must be expanded to support all of the Hierarchical Model Composition, Multistate and Multicomponent Species, Arrays, and Flux Balance Constraints packages to efficiently simulate whole-cell models. Furthermore, the school unified modelers, software developers, and standards developers to develop standardized, open-source tools for whole-cell and other large models.

New parameter estimation, model testing, and visual analysis tools must also be developed to enable researchers to effectively use SBML-encoded whole-cell models for research. In addition, our molecular biology databases must be expanded to facilitate whole-cell model annotation. Furthermore, SBGN and the SBGN viewers must also be expanded to support hybrid diagrams, automatic graph layout, automatic graph reduction, and contextual zooming.

In summary, we believe that whole-cell modeling has the potential to be an important tool for biological discovery, bioengineering, and medicine. Achieving this potential requires new simulation software for simulating whole-cell models. In turn, this requires expanding the whole-cell modeling field including training additional young researchers.
